title: MCP Server Code Changes Require Restart
type: gotcha
status: active
confidence: high
content:
  summary: When modifying MCP server source code, the running server process retains
    old code in memory. Changes won't take effect until the server is restarted or
    you test by running Python directly.
  details: |-
    During development, if you edit source files and then call MCP tools, the running server still uses the old code.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Restart the MCP server process
    2. Test directly via venv: `.venv/bin/python -c "from module import func; func()"`

    The second approach is faster for quick iteration during development.
