title: Config Package - Path Resolution

content:
  summary: Configuration and path resolution for knowledge storage.
  details: 'Config resolution priority:\n1. CLI argument `--data-path`\n2. `KNOWLEDGE_MCP_PATH`
    environment variable\n3. Default: `.knowledge` in current directory\n\nUses `pathlib.Path`
    for cross-platform path handling. The `Config` class ensures absolute paths are
    resolved and required directories exist. Uses `index.yaml` for metadata storage.'
  pitfalls:
  - Relative paths are resolved at startup time - changing working directory later
    won't affect stored paths.
  - GetConfig() creates a default config if none was set, which may not be desired.
