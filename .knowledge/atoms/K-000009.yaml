  summary: Configuration and path resolution for knowledge storage.
  details: |-
    Config resolution priority:
    1. CLI argument `--data-path`
    2. `KNOWLEDGE_MCP_PATH` environment variable
    3. Default: `.knowledge` in current directory

    Uses `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform path handling. The `Config` class ensures absolute paths are resolved and required directories exist. Uses `index.yaml` for metadata storage.
  pitfalls:
  - Relative paths are resolved at startup time - changing working directory later
    won't affect stored paths.
  - GetConfig() creates a default config if none was set, which may not be desired.
